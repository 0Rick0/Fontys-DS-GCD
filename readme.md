# Fontys DS - Getting and Cleaning Data
In this repository I have added some notebooks that prove my capabilities on this subject.

The original assignments are in the folder Original Assignments, but are not my main proof.

Mapping of assignments to notebooks:

- Week 2 -> [Missing Data](Missing%20Data.md)
- Week 3 -> [Cleaning of data](Cleaning%20of%20data.ipynb)
- Week 4 -> [Hadoop Hive](Hadoop%20Hive.md)
- Week 5 -> [Map Reduce](Map%20Reduce.md)
- Week 6 -> [Spark](Spark.ipynb)
- Week 7 -> [MongoDB](MongoDB.ipynb)
